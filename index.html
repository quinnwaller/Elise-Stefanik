		<p> 
			Elise Stefanik (R-NY) is running for reelection in New York’s 21st Congressional District. She has served as the chair of the House Republican Conference since 2021, making her the fourth-highest ranking House Republican. The district borders Vermont and Canada and is majority rural, encompassing most of the Adirondack Mountains and the cities of Ogdensburg, Glens Falls, and Plattsburgh, though excluding the Albany metro area. Stefanik was elected in 2015 as a moderate conservative, but in recent years she has become more conservative and aligned herself with former president Donald Trump. 
		</p>

<h2> Infrastructure and transportation  </h2>
		<p>
			Since much of the 21st District is rural, Stefanik often advocates for increased funding for infrastructure and transportation. In particular, she’s a member of the Congressional Rural Broadband Caucus, which supports boosting broadband internet access for rural communities. However, in November of 2021, Stefanik voted against the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, saying in a press release that has since been deleted from her website that “this Far-Left plan prioritizes Green New Deal policies over traditional infrastructure, such as roads and bridges.” The bill passed, and in July of 2022, she made a trip to the North Country city of Ogdensburg, and <a href=https://x.com/elisestefanik/status/1558780724920012805?s=21&t=aXz5qHzA-sN9FY3bPGKGUw>tweeted</a> that she “proudly delivered $3 million in funding to address degrading conditions of the bridge and help prevent a significant lead-based risk to the environment.” This funding <a href=https://kentingley.substack.com/p/stefaniks-claim-for-delivering-infrastructure> came from the infrastructure bill</a> she had voted against. 
		</p>

	<h2> Reproductive health policies </h2>
		<p>
			While Stefanik opposes abortion and taxpayer funding for abortion, she said in a <a href=https://www.politico.com/story/2014/08/george-w-bush-insider-vies-to-become-youngest-congresswoman-109932> 2014 interview with Politico</a> that it was important for the Republican Party to “bring a compassionate tone when talking about women’s health care issues.” In July 2022, she voted no on several bills related to reproductive health, including the Ensuring Access to Abortion Act, the Women’s Health Protection Act, and the Right to Contraception Act. She has supported legislation that would ban abortion after 15 weeks, with exceptions for rape, incest, and saving the life of the mother. 
		</p>

	<h2> Immigration </h2>
		<p>
			Stefanik has consistently voted in favor of stronger border policies. In July of 2024, Stefanik introduced a resolution entitled “Strongly condemning the Biden Administration and its Border Czar, Kamala Harris's, failure to secure the United States border.” She also helped pass the Secure the Border Act of 2023. While she previously supported DACA, <a href=https://news.wttw.com/sites/default/files/article/file-attachments/2017-12-05-DACA_Letter_1.pdf>signing a letter</a> in 2015 in support of passing a permanent legislative solution for DACA recipients, she voted against the Dream Act of 2021, which would have provided DACA recipients a pathway to citizenship. 
		</p>

	<h2> Views on the validity of the 2020 election </h2>
		<p>
			During the aftermath of the 2020 presidential election, Stefanik supported overturning the results of the election and promoted false claims about its validity. In December of 2020, Stefanik, along with 125 other House Republicans, <a href=https://x.com/EliseStefanik/status/1337216800312979456>signed onto an amicus brief</a> in support of a case that asked the Supreme Court to invalidate millions of ballots in the battleground states of Georgia, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. After the Capitol riot, she voted to reject the certification of Biden’s win in Pennsylvania, although did certify the results in Arizona.
